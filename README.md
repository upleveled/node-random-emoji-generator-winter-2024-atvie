# Node.js Random Emoji Generator

Without any user input: print random emoji

```
node index.js
😀
node index.js
😇
```

With user input of a correct emoji name: print emoji

```
node index.js smiley
😀
node index.js strawberry
🍓
```

With user input of an incorrect emoji name: print error message that emoji doesn't exist

```
node index.js UpLeveled
This emoji does not exist
```
